# The Queen of Spades
## The Text
### Epigraphs (contd.)
The epigraph tells us that the story, in addition to being about the occult, centres around the culture of gambling in 18th-century Russia. It has a documentary value in this respect.  
Thirdly, the Romantic argument underlying the narrative is that emotion (or *sensibility*) is the highest mark of humans, and not logic or rationality – the latter are unnatural constructs, which can be damaging if taken too far.

The first chapter's epigraph describes the opening scene. Like the other epigraphs, it has a summarising value for the corresponding chapter, and in a way, foreshadows what happens in this chapter. It talks of a group of gamblers who bet higher and higher sums, gambling during bad weather.  
The reference to weather is significant, as nature plays a big role in the Romantic view of the world – especially bad weather.

The second chapter's epigraph introduces Lizaveta Ivanovna, in the character of the *lady's maid*. She is a ward of the Countess, who performs odd errands for her as a kind of handmaid.  
It is in French, since it was the language of upper-class society of Russia at this time. It was a demonstration of their status and prestige – it occurs throughout the story in this capacity, *e.g.*, in Tomsky and the Countess's manner of addressing each other. Pushkin subtly draws attention to this, possibly parodying it.  
There is also an irony here, that Hermann is going after Lizaveta simply in order to get at the Countess.

The epigraph of the third chapter makes a statement about the literary culture of his time. This quote references Hermann's letter to Lizaveta, copied word-for-word from a German novel (thus poking fun at German literary practices), and the Countess's statement about the lack of Russian novels – and her later distaste for them.

### The Story within the Story
Consider the story Tomsky tells during the game, of his grandmother's acquaintance with the Comte de Saint-Germain. This references famous legends through history like Casanova (an Italian nobleman famous for being a womaniser), the Wandering Jew (a biblical figure, exiled for insulting Christ as He was crucified), the elixir of life, and the philosopher's stone. Pushkin's aim in this long description is to further root the story in the supernatural, in a sense encouraging us not to believe it.

### Secrets and the Unknown
Secrets make repeated appeareances through the story. For example, the part where Tomsky reveals to the Countess the death of a woman who was presented with her, and where Lizaveta carelessly asked Tomsky a question about his friend.

The unknown also appears in Lizaveta and Hermann's first acquaintance, where it seems like they are communicating some secret without speaking. Hermann's unexplained attraction to the house where the Countess lived is another instance of this. There are also dreams and visions that the characters, especially Hermann, continually see.

All these occurrences, and the nested storytelling, creates an impression of levels of reality and unreality in the story.

### Detail
Pevear considers the story to be minimal in detail. However, Hermann's entry into the Countess's house is marked by long, eloquent descriptions of the furniture and adornments in the room.  
First and foremost, this description has documentary value, talking about the kind of ornaments that upper-class members of society like to have around the house.  
Secondly, it serves to highlight Hermann's relatively low status – not being from the aristocracy, he would have been mildly surprised at the kind of stuff that rich people have lying about. He also takes a mildly mocking tone in this paragraph, displaying a kind of disdain for the idle rich.
