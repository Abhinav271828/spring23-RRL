# The Crocodile (contd.)
## The St. Petersburg Arcade
An *arcade* was a glass-covered passage with cafes and restaurants on either side, meant for wealthy upper-class clients. It also offered a *public contact zone* for various social groups. Arcades were also associated with entertainment and exhibitions.

Chernyshevsky's novel, *Что делать?* ("What is to be done?") ends in the Passage, as a centre of contemporary intellectual thought. The newspapers always wrote about it, depicting it as the centre of elegant shopping, popular entertainment, public enlightenment, and literary activity.

Dostoyevsky's dislike for the Passage is also connected to the Crystal Palace – the culmination of the same building style, of glass and iron, which is apt for "utopian imaginings". He considered the Passage the home of the thought that European thought was a prison for Russia's cultural development.

## The Epigraph
The epigraph was a nonsensical refrain that was popular in Paris around this time, which St. Petersburg also picked up on. Dostoyevsky imitates the style of trifling discourse common to feuilletonists throughout Part I, but then parodies this style in the rest of the story.

The feuilleton was a genre of newspaper writing that was born around the same time as the Arcade. It was a combination of journalistic reporting and fictional narrative, which formed an informal voice of narration.

## The First Description of the Crocodile
The first description of the crocodile in the story tells us that it is lying motionless, in the "inhospitable" climate of St. Petersburg.  
Once Ivan Matveich is inside the crocodile, he starts lecturing on education, the natural sciences, economics, and foreign capital.

The crocodile is a composite figure standing for many things that Dostoyevsky (and *Епоха*) could not stand. It represents an idea of Europe that was consuming liberal Russian society. After all, Ivan Matveich ends up in the crocodile just when he is about to leave for Europe, and is agreed to be on his European vacation when inside.  
The crocodile, screening inhospitable climate and being warm and comfortable, and represents the alien, narrow, false comfort of western civilisation and ideas in Russia.  
The German couple, introducing European rationalist rhetoric, receive enthusiastic support among the Russian people.

## The Target of Dostoyevsy's Satire
Mainly, Dostoyevsky intended to critique the feuilleton ("the trivial discourse of the daily press, taken to an absurd extreme in the text"), and the "imported culture of spectacle" contained in the Passage.
