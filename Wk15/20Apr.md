# The Crocodile
## The Target of Dostoyevsky's Satire (contd.)
Dostoyevsky considered the Arcade to represent everything that was wrong with Russia, and critiques the feuilleton (which reported incessantly, ridiculously and emptily about the Arcade). He also mocks the bourgeois liberals' enthusiasm for foreign capital investment, which was discussed extensively in *Голос* ("The Voice").

One of the feuilletons mockingly quoted by Dostoyevsky reports that Ivan Matveich ate the crocodile – this suggests that Russia is benefiting from the economic and cultural possibilities of European influence. On the other hand, another one claims that he jumped right into the crocodile, and this is a satire on the savagery of Russia, jumping straight into European culture without appreciating its "useful" and "humane" possibilities.

Thus the Arcade represents the decline and servility of Russia in Dostoyevsky's eyes, the way the Crustal Palace represented the decline of a capitalist society driven by material prosperity. The Arcade's monstrous curiosities for spectacle demonstrated, to him, that there was no real advantage to the false ideals of European progress. Even Ivan Matveich keeps saying that the crocodile is "dark and empty" from the inside, and that he is just a voice – *голос* – driven by the ideology of European progress.

# Anton Pavlovich Chekhov
Chekhov had a very different background from most classic Russian writers; his grandfather was a serf who had freed himself and his family before the Emancipation. His father was a grocer.  
He grew up with a traditional Orthodox Christian education, but lost his faith later. He lived in a big family, with five siblings and simple, pious parents. When his father fled to Moscow to avoid debtors' prison, he taught to get himself through school (eventually becoming a doctor) and supported his family by writing sketches and stories in popular magazines.

Chekhov's second collection, however, did so well that he gave up medicine. His plays, too, were equally successful.  
He was criticised by people who believed that writing should have an ideology and a message – he believed in art for art's sake, and wrote in *lyrical realism*, or realism without a social purpose. His opinion was that a writer must be detached and modest, without grand gestures, focusing on their craft. Maupassant was an important influence to him.
