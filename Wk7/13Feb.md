# The Nose
## Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol (contd.)
Nikolai Gogol did not belong to the Ukrainian popular tradition, but wrote about Ukrainian provincial life from a Russian cosmopolitan perspective. Despite maintaining this point of view, he never went into the life of St. Petersburg. Pevear calls Gogol a Modernist writer, one of the reasons for which is this "in-betweenness" of his position (the Modernist era was marked by a tendency towards experimentation and individualistic themes).

Ukraine is depicted in Gogol's work as a kind of pastoral utopia, with a magical and almost operatic or theatrical character. Although described as a realist, the real life of Ukrainians in the provinces has no place in his work. His work follows themes of idyllic provincial life into which the uncanny and the supernatural intervene.

He has a strange sense of humour, poking fun at the illusion of reality. *The Nose* shows this in the adherence to social practices and constructs despite everything else, even in such an extreme case. It ridicules the hollowness of bureaucracy.

## Interpretations
This work has a number of aspects that are focused on in various interpretations:

* **Social Critique.** This reading emphasises the hypocrisy of official pretensions and state hierarchies.
* **Religious Message.** The day the barber found the nose in the bread, March 25th, is one of the most important feast days in the Orthodox Christian calendar – The Feast of the Annunciation, which celebrates the day that Gabriel informed Mary that she would bear the son of God. The fact that the world is upside-down in this story, that nothing is as it seems, may hint at a move towards the Apocalypse (the second coming of Christ).  
    Another religious reading is the absurdity, and insignificance, of religion in the face of the domination of the Table of Ranks above everything else.
* **Laughter for its own sake.** The story can be seen as having no meaning of its own – it is complete in itself, with laughter as an end.
* **Illusion of reality.** The story highlights the fact that all things that we hold so dear and so important are hollow fictional constructs.

## The Text
Gogol weaves many everyday nuances of life into the text. He describes how the barber dresses, the airs he puts on, his wife's thoughts about the coffee refill, and his concern about her feelings. There is also something appropriate in the fact that Ivan Yakovlevich is the one to come across the nose, being a habitual drunkard.

There is a mirroring in the endings of the first and second parts – we are unaware what happens to Ivan Yakovlevich after his encounter with the policeman, and the phrase "shrouded in mist" is used again after the description of the rumours and talks about the nose walking around.

The text also remarks about the corruption prevalent in the Caucasus, being an outpost far from the administrative eye of St. Petersburg. He shows Kovalev as a collegiate assessor made in the Caucasus, presumably by exchanging favours rather than studying hard.
