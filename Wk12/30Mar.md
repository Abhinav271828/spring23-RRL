Some common themes across the works we have seen so far are:

* Napolean as a Romantic hero – visionary, reckless
* Serfdom (Turgenev, Tolstoy)
* Orientalism (Lermontov)
* Self-conscious, self-reflective
* Artistic experiments, structural layers
* Framed narratives
* Depiction in parody of aristocratic life – salon culture, duels (Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Pavlova, Volkonskaya)
* Intrigue (Pushkin, Pavlova)
* Slavophilism vs. Westernisation – what is the Russian nation?
* Occult, supernatural (Volkonskaya, Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov)
* Urban hierarchy, social status, bureaucracy (Gogol, Turgenev)
* Outliers, ambiguity of purpose (Pavlova, Volkonskaya, Gogol)
