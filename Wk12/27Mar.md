# A Spark Neglected Burns the House
## Non-Realistic Features
The story has some very particular non-realistic features – this is uncharacteristic in an age when realism was the dominant movement in literature in Russia. One such feature is that there is no sense of historical time – there are no indications of the period at which it is taking place (apart from the reference to the Battle of Plevna), and so it is made out to be applicable at any time and place.

The language in this story is also significant. It has a rhyming quality, closer to the speech patterns of the people. Tolstoy, in many of his works of popular literature, went out of his way to go against the established conventions of literary, written Russian.

Another feature of this story reminiscent of folktales and fairytales is the recurring theme of the number three, such as with the trope of the three sons. The youngest son being the least "special" in some way is also a recurrent theme in Russian folklore, of which the archetype is *Иван-дурак*, or "Ivan the Fool".  
There are a number of other folkloric archetypes as well – wise old people, rash young people, quarrelsome women, children learning from grown-ups, and peasants content with their lot.

## "Love Thy Neighbour"
The story makes the point that one sin leads to another – the sin of anger, or wrath, leads on to violence, gossip, backbiting, stealing, lies, and threats. It eventually takes a turn when Gavryl hits Ivan's pregnant daughter-in-law. It takes a violation of Gavryl's basic human dignity – his sentence of 20 lashes – to make Ivan reflect.

## Forebodings
The story contains many examples of portents of things to come, of which the most striking is the title – *Упустишь огонь - не потусишь* ("You will miss the fire if you do not extinguish it") – which is a proverb in Russian. Later examples are Gavryl's threat, Ivan's reaction to it, his father's advice and caution, and particularly the weather that night.
