# At the Tea-Table
## Epigraph 2 (contd.)
Not ending a story forces the reader to think about aspects of the story that don't necessarily have the same prominence if the story is wrapped up. This is a perspective of Pavlova that resurfaced in the 20th and 21st centuries, but that was unique in her time.


## Positions in the Debate
The framing story presents a society conversation, representing positions that different people would have taken on the "woman question" – are women weak inherently, or by upbringing? Aleksei Petrovich and Bulanin take opposite sides of this debate.  
The conversation also goes to women's perspective on relationships and what they look for.

## Polyphony and Polysemy
The story has different levels of meaning and presenting ideas and thoughts. Multiple languages (Latin, French, Turkish), texts (Heinrich Hesse's poem, George Sand's novel *Simon*), ways of communication (verbal, non-verbal) and levels of storytelling (the frame story and the inner story) present themselves.

## Salon Culture
Aleksei Petrovich, the narrator of the inner story, talks about the salon culture of Moscow and Russia in general. He refers to the "cost" of a meal at a princely home, which is good conversation, with anecdotes, discussions, or poems.  
Another part of salon culture is *promenading* – a leisurely walk that the upper class engaged in, mainly for social reasons. It was also partially a performance of power and wealth.

## Commentary on Art
The Princess and Khzorevsky have a discussion on the influence of art – the Princess speaks eloquently about the "power that elegance has" and the "force of genius", while Khozrevsky speaks plainly about its prosaic and mundane effects.

## Aleksei Petrovich as a Narrator
Aleksei Petrovich's narration almost overshadows that of the framing story, which is unobtrusive and smooth. Aleksei, on the other hand, presents judgments and opinions on the characters and culture of the time.  
He also highlights the difference between the conventions of novelistic narration and those of realistic narration, and emphasises his position in that spectrum, thus lending credibility to his anecdote.
