# At the Tea-Table (contd.)
## What Is the Point?
Aleksei Petrovich regrets that he cannot end his story – nobody dies early or gets married. This is a reference to the convention in literature to kill off characters who have no further purpose in the story, or wrap up unfinished romances by marriages. This story doesn't preclude any other possibilities, and doesn't give us any answers.

# A Spark Neglected Burns the House
## Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoi
Count Leo Tolstoy belonged to a highly aristocratic family, which dated back to the fourteenth century. His father fought in the Patriotic War of 1812, and his mother was a princess of the Volkonskaya family.  
He lost both his parents in his childhood and was an indifferent student, and lived on his estate after dropping out of Kazan University.

He had a gambling problem and enlisted in the army as a young man, but was later shocked by the brutality and refuses to serve the state. In his later life, he returns to Christian values after a profound moral crisis, and wishes to renounce his wealth.

## The Story
This story is an example of what is considered "popular literature", which generally falls under three categories:

* folklore, narrated by wandering minstrels or storytellers (Pushkin's fairytales)
* educated writers writing about folk or popular characters (Turgenev's stories)
* works created by writers specifically for a popular audience; commercial writing (Tolstoi's works)

It follows a theme that was considered suitable for the common people at the time – the ethical teachings of Christ. Stories of this kind used poetically rich language, but logical and straightforward, and without loanwords. Tolstoi had believed for a long time that literary Russian was inferior to ordinary spoken Russian, and that the approach to popular literature was very condescending.

*A Spark Neglected* has been interpreted in several ways:

* a re-invention of *Exemplum* – a story told as part of a sermon to make a point about a doctrine
* a morality-tale – a medieval play in which characters represent certain attributes and a protagonist is driven to temptation and then redeemed
* a parable – a simple story that illustrates a moral or spiritual lesson
