# Asheek-Kerib
## Folktales and Fairytales (contd.)
Lermontov's version of Asheek-Kerib is an example of a *rewritten* text – he sees no obligation to "stay true" to the original version, if there is any such.

This story proceeds in a very direct, sequential manner. It has at its heart, like every fairytale does, a quest.  
It has very little excess information, and there is hardly no character development – individualising traits are very few. This is an instance of the formulaic, consistent character of fairytales, and oral literature in general. Furthermore, the lack of specificity goes towards the relatability of these characters.

The term *asheek-kerib* is a general one used for wandering minstrels in the Southern Caucasus. The first word comes from *aashiq*, which can mean either "lover" or "seeker", and the second from *qarib* or *gharib*, which means "stranger" or "wanderer".  
It is described as a *Турецкая Сказка* (mistranslated as "story") – a Turkish fairytale. It was discovered posthumously among Lermontov's works and dismissed by many western scholars like Belinsky. However, Lermontov does not identify a source for it, and in doing so, claims it as an act of creation.  
Traditionally, the fairytale is in origin a *dastaan* – a kind of epic fantasy structured as a cycle of tales. It has been heavily condensed by Lermontov into this short, written fairytale, putting it in the genre of сказка (a "literary fairytale"), recognisable to his Russian readership. This was seen as elevating or adding value to the folktales told by ordinary people. It, however, still retains some qualities of the epic – for example, the return, or homecoming, of the hero. The plot (сюжет) of the written version remains the same, but the story (фабула – including imagery, language, rhetoric, and dialogue) differs.

*Asheek-Kerib* furthers the Orientalist discourse in the context of the literature of the Russian Empire. It represents, therefore, "a land to which one may poetically fall 'captive'", but which must come under imperialist expansion. The Russian Orientalist view included many peoples and regions that fell outside the Slavic "centre" of the Federation, like Siberia, the Crimea, and Central Asia. This particular fairytale, then, represents the Russian "vision" of the people of the Caucasus, and Russian imperial control of this region makes Lermontov's translation possible.

The story displays many essential fairytales elements. We have already mentioned the quest; we also have, for instance, the archetypal beauty (Magul-Megeri). The language also possesses a formulaic quality typical of orality, and a lyricism of syntax. There is a preference for colons and semicolons over periods, indicative of Lermontov's desire to retain a sense of the oral.
