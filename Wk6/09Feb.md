# Asheek-Kerib (contd.)
## The Wandering Hero
Lermontov, according to some scholars, seems to have been fascinated with the archetype of the "wandering hero" or "wandering poet". It has been hypothesised that this may be partially because he identified himself as one – he viewed the Caucasus as his "citadel of freedom", while in effective exile from a regime he disagreed with. Furthermore, this character becomes the archetypical image of the Poet/Creator – one who has existed since before writing, and is prehistoric in some ways. This is related to the idea that the act of naming is an act of creation, which makes creators of poets and writers.

This latter perspective is part of Lermontov's poetics (his theory and perspective on literature). His last work before his exile, *Смерть Поэта* ("Death of a/the Poet") – this may be interpreted as the death of the archetype of the poet, and not of a specific one (*i.e.*, Pushkin).

Other theories present Asheek-Kerib as a "Poet-Prophet". There are three references to Haderiliaz in the text, where Asheek sings of how God, or Allah, gave him wings and brought him to Tiflis in one day. Thus he paints Haderiliaz as an agent of God. This is the first point at which Asheek uses "I" in his song – he becomes a true lyric hero, who is also a prophet, since his song is connected to a transcendent truth. Thus Kurshud-Bek accepts what he says.  
This sequence of events is a metaphor for the transformative experience that a poet undergoes in exile.

# The Nose
## Resistance in Ukraine
At the time of this story, the Crimean Peninsula was a point of conflict in the Russian Empire. Cossacks (or Kazaks (not Kazakhs)) were eastern Slavic people living in Ukraine and sourthern Russia, and believed that they were the original people of the 'Rus, and that the Russian Empire was a usurper. They were Orthodox Christians, led by a leader called a Hetman.

The Cossacks were involved in a long struggle with another ethnic group, called the Crimean Tatars. This group was led by a leader called a Khan. Russia annexed the Crimea from the Ottomans in 1783, but lost a war in this region in 1852 against Britain, France, Sardinia and the Ottoman Empire.

In 1944, Stalin began a process of ethnic cleansing in this region, and deported thousands of Tatars to Uzbekistan. Crimea, in 1954, went to Ukraine.

The Cossacks and the Tatars frequently allied with the enemies of the Russian Empire, to resist the imposition of homogeneity by the autocracy.

## Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol
Gogol was born in Ukraine amd raised on his mother's estate, and was sent to boarding school near Kyiv. He struggled to hold down government jobs, and wrote a poem that he was so ashamed of that he bought back all the copies and burnt them. Later, however, he published *Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka*, which achieved instant success.

Pushkin, impressed with his work, published many of his works (including *The Nose*) in *Sovremennik*. He left for western Europe, and lived there for the last few years of his life.

His perspective lies between cosmopolitan Russia and provincial Ukraine. His writing includes themes of folklore and idyllic nature and provincial life. However, he does not realistically depict the life of real Ukrainians in the provinces.
