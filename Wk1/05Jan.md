# Introduction
Some of the greatest prose in world literature belongs to nineteenth-century Russia, including authors like Lev Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Anton Chekhov. It also forms the basis for the modern understanding of many aspects of society, politics, philosophy and psychology.

The main questions we will consider are:

* What were the major concerns and moments of Russian literature in the 19th century, and how are they still relevant?
* How did the form of the Russian short story change over the century, and in what socio-cultural context?
* What was the long-term impact of these events for literature in general?

### Peter the Great
Peter the Great was the fifth Tsar of the Ramanov dynasty, considered responsible for ushering Russia into the future by forcing its westernisation. He did this by introducing the European ordering of time (counting years from the birth of Christ and starting the year in January), and forced western clothing and grooming on the court and people. He also built the Russian Navy to improve Russia's maritime position, and shifted the capital to St. Petersburg from Moscow.  
His move towards westernisation extended to the arts as well – he initiated the creation of westernised Russian art and architecture, mostly in the new capital.

This trend continued after Peter's death as well, propagated both by both the upper classes and his successors.

Peter's reign saw very little fiction, poetry and drama, but oral and manuscript-based literary culture flourished. Non-fiction had a huge uptick, however – military, political and religious treatises were sponsored to a large extent.
