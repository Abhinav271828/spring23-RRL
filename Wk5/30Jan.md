# The Dream: A Letter
## The Figure (contd.)
The figure in the dream also addresses the Princess's son, and in this passage highlights the privilege of knowledge. This paints Egypt as a symbol of knowledge and wisdom, which is not privy to everyone – only to those deserving of it.

## A Tone of Apology
Volkonskaya, towards the end of the text, takes a tone of extreme apology towards Gulyanov – which to some extent can be ascribed to convention (see below). The implication is that she sees Gulyanov as a representative of the Enlightenment and of rationalism, and herself, in direct opposition, as a symbol of romanticism and the imagination.

Women writers in Russia at this time were restricted to certain ways of writing and places to publish in – in part due to Nikolai Karamzin's published views. They were encouraged to be "modest and unpretentious", which pushed women writers to preface their text with "excuses, figures of self-disparagement, and protestations of lack of ambition". This derived from their immediate artistic and financial dependency on male patrons.

This points us to the idea that this is a literary work – written with intent to publish, and not to actually be sent to Gulyanov or anyone. One reason she couches her thoughts in the frame of a letter, rather than (for instance) a story, is to lend credence to it by the mention of Gulyanov's name. Addressing it to him, in addition, makes him a passive character – a listener, a recipient – which means that he gets to say nothing in this text. She is enabled to say what she likes, and state her opinions without (even imagined) debate.

# Asheek-Kerib
## Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov
Lermontov was a Russian Romantic poet and writer. He, too, had noble origins and a family history of military service, and was brought up in a sheltered and privileged manner by his maternal grandmother, in the Caucasus mountains. He was a voracious reader and accomplished polyglot.

He took Pushkin's death very much to heart, and almost had a nervous breakdown on receiving the news. He wrote *Death of a Poet* as a tribute to him, which earned him the title of "Pushkin's Heir". Unlike Pushkin, however, he was a complex, contrary man, and a brave but boastful soldier.

He was imprisoned and later demoted, and transferred to the Caucasus (which, in fact, he loved). He wrote extensively about the Southern Caucasus, including Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia (which represented, to Russia, "the Orient").

## Folktales and Fairytales
Asheek-Kerib is described as a story (more accurately, a fairytale) from Turkey. It is a retelling of an anonymous romantic *dastaan*, *Aashiq-Qarib* (The Wandering Minstrel), which was popular and common to the Southern Caucasus, Central Asia and Turkey.  
It is part of Lermontov's fascination with Caucasian folklore (following Pushkin's with Russian folklore).

[This edition](../Readings/Asheek-Kerib.pdf) was printed in 1983 and 1987, during the Soviet Era, which was obsessed with folk culture across the "Russian Federation". This was a way to unite people, and create a common cultural identity, stemming from the tales told by ordinary people.  
Pushkin's and Lermontov's fondness for these stories has a similar root – the cultural consolidation of the Russian Empire. Thus, the role of empire and appropriation in the context of these stories needs to be examined.
