# The Ethics of Telling a Story

# Pros and Cons – The Thoughts and Dreams of Madame Court Counsellor Lisitsyna
## Background
During the mid-19th century, a strong left-wing movement (aiming for social and economic equality) began to take hold in Russia. This movement included the "emancipation" of women, of which a major component was education. The debates and discussions centred around this movement used literature and translation as major vehicles for diffusion and outreach.  
An important text of this period was Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel *Что делать?* ("What is to be done?").

Women's education began from gymnasiums (high schools that girls attended for a few years from 8 years of age) in 1858, and then extended to university lectures in 1859. University courses opened to women by the end of the 1860s.

*Pros and Cons* was written by Soboleva in 1863.

## Sofya Pavlovna Soboleva
Sofya Soboleva is an obscure writer, both during her time as well as in recent years. She was born with the surname Lavrova in Schlusselberg, near St. Petersburg, and her father was an engineer. She was initially educated at home, and then went to a *pension*.  
She married after school and separated soon after, supporting herself with a teaching job.

She wrote under the pseudonym of V. Samoilovich, since writing was considered a "manly pursuit", in the words of Nikolai Nekrasov. After 1867, she shifted to children's writing (under her own name), and received immediate critical acclaim.

## The Text
The subtitle *The Thoughts and Dreams of Madame Court Counsellor Lisitsyna* gives the first-person narrator the status of a character. The story offers a critical documentation of social life and the process and discourse of Russian women's education.

From the beginning, the narrator-protagonist feels the need to justify their ideological affiliations (since they are unusual at the time). There is also a constant awareness of the reader – they are involved in the process of creation of the narrative (characteristic of self-reflexivity).

She criticises the contemporary conventions of Russian literature – especially women writers like Elena Gan and Mariya Zhukova – mocking it in a reductive description likened to a template. She participates in literary discourse via fiction, which was a common resort for women writers at the time.

She summarily dismisses from consideration upper-class, financially independent women – they have control over their lives and can choose to remain single.  
It is not thought necessary to equip women with profession skills, since marriage is the social and cultural ideal for all women. Soboleva makes the point that women of lesser classes are not exempt from financial uncertainty even after marriage.  
She also notes that the circumstances for women to succeed (sustained quality education and social investment) are absent, which is the reason for the lack of great women scientists and thinkers.

Zina is a social experiment for her family – her education gives her a superficial knowledge and no real depth or perspective. However, Lyuba is intelligent, but lacks the opportunity to educate herself.
