# Pros and Cons – The Thoughts and Dreams of Madame Court Counsellor Lisitsyna (contd.)
## Lyubinka's Decision
Zina and Yakov Ivanovich are reckless and immature (despite being educated), while Lyubinka is clear-headed and keeps her integrity. Her wise practical decision is contrasted with Zina's fickle affections and Yakov Ivanovich's empty infatuation – Soboleva uses this situation to portray the great pity that Lyubinka's potential was never recognised or channelled by the Russian education system of the early 1860s.

## The End and Autobiography
The story ends with Lyubinka talking about the permanent nature of change and mortality.  
Furthermore, by the very nature of autobiographies, they cannot be complete. This story, too, is incomplete – it hands over the last word to Lyubinka. Thus "Lisitsyna's autobiography belongs to Lyubinka and is marked by incompleteness."

While autobiographies are supposed to be centred around sincerity, this account is not like that.

## What Do We Learn?
This story does a lot of things:

* It reaffirms literature as a platform that enables us to imagine scenarios and put ourselves in someone's shoes. It exposes us to social critique along with literary criticisms, through the one genre that women were considered "able" to write.
* It represents a particualr moment in the historical discourse on women's education; it argues in favour of women's education.

# The Crocodile
## Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky
Dostoyevsky is known for his documentation of several social, cultural and political phenomena of his time. He was born into a middle- or upper-middle-class family in Moscow, but his father later rose to the lowest aristocratic rank. He had a strict upbringing, and knew French and Latin.  
His first novel, *Poor Folk*, was shown by his roommate to Vissarion Belinsky, which gave him immediate success.

When he returns to St. Petersburg after his exile, his marriage, and his wife's death, and nobody knows him anymore. He starts a literary journal *Время* ("Time"), which regains him his name. In this environment, he discovers Nikolai Chernyshevsky, the face of Russian radicalism and his worst enemy.

He remarried, this time to his stenographer Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina, and they had four children together.

In his later life, he arrived at a well-defined ideological position – a right-wing Slavophile Christian conservative. His writing puts his characters in situations that drive them to their limits, and then seeks to explore how they think and act. He was preoccupied with the inner workings of the human mind.

He was appointed a member of the élite Russian Academy of Sciences. He presented a tribute to Pushkin in 1880, when his first memorial was constructed. He died the next year, of emphysema.

## The Literary Prank
Dostoyevsky intended for this story to be a simple prank, an attempt at a Gogolesque story, but it caused so much outrage that the journal it was published in, *Епоха* ("Epoch"), shut down after this issue. This was because it was seen as a mockery of Chernyshevsky, who (since he was in prison at the time) was the subject of much sympathy in the public eye.
