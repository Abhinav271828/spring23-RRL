# Pros and Cons – The Thoughts and Dreams of Madame Court Counsellor Lisitsyna (contd.)
## Social Critique
There are many examples of social critique in the text, beyond the education of women.

Madame Lisitsyna criticises upper-class women for their empty lives – she says that "setting examples is their specialty". By means of her husband, she also satirises the shallow engagement of educated Russians with French liberalism, and concurrently, the *mode* in France of having liberal opinions at the time.

## Parallels and Mirroring
Zina and Lyuba are painted in opposite lights, complementing each other, to make her point about women's education.

Grigory Temryukov and Lyuba are also paralleled in that they are both poor relations of rich people, who transcend the ignominy of their circumstances, and are morally superior to the superficial life they are exposed to.

## Soboleva's Ideology
Madame Lisitsyna uses irony and sarcasm to respond to stereotypes of women and their place in the world. An example of this is her answer to the accusation that women are "deceiving coquettes". She also uses grand language in describing Yakov Ivanovich's letter to highlight his absurdity.

Soboleva uses Lisitsyna as a mouthpiece for her ideology in her description of Russian society to Yakov Ivanovich. She talks about the emptiness and the emphasis on appearances of Russian society.  
She puts herself in the idealist school, arguing that women should be educated for their own sake, and not in order to be "useful to society" (the instrumentalist perspective).

However, there is some amount of hypocrisy in this. The only two examples of educated women are Madame Lisitsyna herself, and Zina, and they do not paint a very good picture.
