# Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (contd.)
## The Lady with a Little Dog
### The Passage of Time
Time passes in Chekhov's stories, at some points, very slowly, and with small events that illustrate the slowness of its passage. For example, the half-hour that passed in silence in Anna Sergeevna's hotel room is marked by Gurov eating a watermelon slice, the candles flickering, and so on. Another point where this happens is the scene of post-coital ennui, where Gurov is bored listening to Anna's guilty ramblings.

Chekhov also pays attention to the aural image, by focusing on ambient sounds, and associating this with the passing of time and the change of seasons.

### Mundaneness of Life
Gurov is in turmoil that he lives two lives, and the one he is "supposed to live", his public one, is much less interesting and essential to him than his private, secret, affair-filled life.

### The End
Chekhov, like Pavlova, does not give a satisfactory conclusion to the story. However, unlike her, he simply stops, with no grand truth or climax – as opposed to the sudden, jarring conclusions that Pavlova gives her stories.

## Death of a Clerk
The character names in this story are thinly veiled puns – Cherviakov comes from *червяк*, meaning "worm", and Brizzhalov means either "the sprayed upon", or "the grumbler".

The narrator makes the sneeze even more absurd by sincerely narrating it, as if it is beyond their control, as if they are an observer outside the story.

# Important Themes
The most important themes we have seen are:

* The Westerniser vs. Slavophile debate: What is the Russian identity, and what is at its core? What is the "self" and the "other"?
* The shift from romanticism (the Gothic, the uncanny, folklore, nature and human beings, patriotism and nationalism) to realism (psychological realism, social manners, inequalities, critique of the state apparatus, lyrical realism): The major milestones are Pushkin (a romantic), Turgenev (the first realist writer), and Chekhov (the beginner of lyrical realism).
* Political, didactic and ideological writing
* Shifts in genre
* A tradition of writing by women in Russian, some part of and some marginal to the mainstream
* Aristocracy, bureaucracy and feudalism
* Reflections on translation: Our understanding of the politics of translation begins with Lermontov (his translation of folk stories), and then we see Turgenev (whose working-class language in Russian was not translated well), and the women writers.
