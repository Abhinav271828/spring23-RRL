# The Nose (contd.)
## The Narrator's Inclusion of Self
Gogol's narrator speaks in a friendly, thoughtful manner, and the text is written in a way that suggests that the narrator is merely conversing about an interesting occurrence. It creates an impression of spontaneity and liveliness.  
The way the story moves, with plot points being abruptly dropped off and picked up again, is suggestive of the *unreliable narrator* – a theme common in post-WWII literature. This aspect of the story is meta-textual – it is about the telling of a story, not what happens in the story itself.

# The Office
## Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev
Turgenev was born into an old aristocratic family in the city of Oryol in 1818. He had some non-Russian (Tatar)ancestry, and grew up on his mother's estate in Spasskoye. He was a staunch Westerniser, and was educated in French and German (he spoke French at home).  
He was not particularly religious, and did not lean either to the right- or left-wing.

He began wroting poems in the 1830s, but was recognised only in the mid-1840s. His talent was especially appreciated in prose, and in 1847, he wrote *A Hunter's Notebook* (Записки охотника), which was published in *Sovremennik*. He was arrested and exield to his estate at Spasskoye.  
Many of his works depicted rural life before the Emancipation of the Serfs in 1861.

He never married, but he had many affairs with serfs, as well as one with the opera singer Pauline Viardot.

## Features of Realism
Many aspects of dialogue in the story give it a realistic colour – people interrupt each other, leave their sentences unfinished, and in general display many conversational dysfluencies. The narrator also describes many minor, irrelevant details throughout the story – objects by the wayside, in a sense.
