# The Office
## Features of Realism (contd.)
A third feature of realism, related to conversation, is the use of different dialects and registers of language.

The narrator also does not pass moral judgment on the characters – at least, he does not reveal his opinions.

## The Office
Most of the story takes place in an *estate office*, belonging to Mrs. Losnyakova. It is staffed by a number of clerks and cashiers, headed by a chief clerk (who has his own room). The estate is not very large, as we can guess from the number of servants.

All the staff are corrupt – they expect bribes for anything they are asked to do. They turn hospitable as soon as the narrator offers to pay. Furthermore, the description makes it clear that the work ethic of the entire place is very lax.

The absurdity of the functioning of the office is illustrated in the official order that Fedyushka showed the narrator. This letter is written in a semi-official way, but there is a dissonance between this tone and the contents – which enquire into a triviality. The clerk is obsessed with the handwriting more than anything else, even though the actual phrasing has come from somewhere else.  
Turgenev makes a statement on Russian aristocracy by including this letter in the task – he points out that the nobles have lost track of the difference between petty and important issues.

## Rhetorical Strategies of Negotation
We see many negotiating strategies in the exchange between the merchant, Gavrila Antonych, and Nikolay Yeremeich. For example,

* invoking God
* invoking threats (to approach the landlady) and calling bluffs
* flattery
* faint sense of injury

## Intertextuality, Ekphrasis, Allusion
Intertextuality is writers referring to other literary texts or authors in their work. It tells us about the world of the story, and adds richness and nuance to the text. For example, the narrator mentions Daniel Defoe's *Robinson Crusoe* when describing the old man, which tell us about his literary exposure and cultural knowledge.  
Ekphrasis is the description of a visual work of art as a literary device. The descriptions of the paintings in the office show that they are not very good – the narrator subtly points out the lack of perspective and the poor use of foreshortening by the artist. The themes of the paintings also show that the artist has pretensions to grandeur, and is not a serf or middle-class artist.

## Teatime
Turgenev is known for his descriptions of teatime. This story, like many of his other works, has a detailed description of the ritual of teatime, and the ingredients that go into making tea.

## Levels of Narrative
There are different ways of writing that we see throughout the text, forming levels of narrative – the main narration, the folk song, and the official order, to name some. This diversity has a documentary and ethnographic function – it archives social hierarchies and their reflections in language, social groups, language usage conventions, etc.

## The Narrator
The narrator in the story is an outsider, an impartial observer. It is also made clear that he is an aristocratic – he is sometimes described as a *landowner*, and his expectation of tea is also another sign of this.  
He does not interrupt or intervene in any of the proceedings – he is simply there to report. Turgenev follows here the realist convention of an impartial, unobtrusive narrator.

He both belongs and does not belong to the world of the story, but at the same time our only view of that world is through him. He interprets customs and mannerisms (like Nikolai Yeremeich using his third finger, manorial servants using feminine forms of address).

He is an *unwanted presence* for the people of the story – he pretends to be asleep, while it is very clear that the people want to make sure he is not eavesdropping.
