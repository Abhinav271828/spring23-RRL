# The Cultural History of Russia
## Romanticism vs. Realism
The Enlightenment brought an emphasis on rationality and reason, which was a reaction to the ignorance and unbridled power of state and religion.  
The romanticist movement in art brought focus on beauty, imagination, expression and sensibility. It was founded on the idea that there is truth in things that cannot be quantified by reason or logic – it was a reaction to the Enlightenment's emphasis on the latter. Romanticism also influenced the ideas of national sentiment (through a shared collective heritage), and of a nation being its people; this was the driving force behind the major revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. The movement also produced the ideas of originality.

Realism, on the other hand, mimics or represents reality, which romanticism makes no attempt towards. It strives towards a "true" presentation of its subject, with all its flaws and shortcomings.

# The Queen of Spades
## Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin
The 1820s and 1830s saw the emergence of an independent Russian literary culture, which is unique to Russia and distinctly Russian in perspective. One of the most important milestones of this period is Pushkin's publication of *Evgeny Onegin*, a novel in verse. Later, he went on to launch the *Sovremennik*, Russia's most famous literary journal.

At this time, Vissarion Belinsky (Russia's first professional critic) published his first article, which is celebrated as the "manifesto of a new era in the history of Russian civilisation". He was a social reformer who emphasised the need to represent things like feudalism in art.

At the time of the Decembrists' Revolt, Pushkin was in exile. However, his poem *Ode to Liberty* was found among the possessions of the Decembrists. He was summoned to Moscow and placed under state surveillance.

Pushkin is believed to be the greatest Russian poet and the founder of modern Russian prose. He belonged to Russia's old nobility – his family went back to the 12th century. He took pride in his African heritage (his mother was descended from a freed slave) and of his family history of political protest.

His first language was French, and he started writing in it at the age of 14. He spent most of his life in exile or in house arrest, writing prolifically. Imprisoned on his mother's estate, he listened to the fairytales his nanny, Arina Rodionovna (a serf) told him. He was initially ridiculed, but things changed with Aleksandr Afanasiev's collection of folktales.

He married Natalya Goncharovna in 1831, after proposing to her a second time. He died as a result of a duel, in response to allegations that his wife was having an affair.

## The Text
Pushkin's epigraph positions the book in the realm of the occult from the very beginning – it is uncertain whether it is his own statement or actually quoted from a fortunetelling book.
