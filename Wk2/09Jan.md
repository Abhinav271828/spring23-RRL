# The Cultural History of Russia
## The Russian Enlightenment (contd.)
### Catherine the Great
Philosophers, scientists and artists formed the driving force behind the Russian Enlightenment, who attributed the ignorance they saw around them to the self-advancing nature of the Church and State. The Enlightenment's central themes were reason and rationality, and it saw the rise of *enlightened absolutism* – the idea that the ideal form of governance is monarchy by a rational leader, much like a parent.

Catherine II was an extremely driven collector and creator of art, including literature and painting. She introduced neoclassicism, which promoted a return to Greco-Roman artistic and philosophical principles. This is an instance of the theme of classicism that ran through the entire 18th century in Russia, also illustrated by baroque, rococo, and Gothic movements. Cultural inspiration was drawn predominantly from German and French sources, rather than Ukrainian and Polish.  
Catherine, unlike Peter, did not restrict herself to reforms within St. Petersburg. She transformed all civic buildings across the empire to follow neoclassical principles.

Drama was the predominant form of literature, and its major trends had a didactic or moralistic turn at this time (with some comedic elements). Catherine herself wrote twenty-five plays, using them to satirise "foibles and abuses of the system", and "human vices in general".  
Russian novelists wrote on the model of French and British novels, and translations from French and English works accounted for 25% of all publishing. There were over 500 literary journals in the 1780s, in which Catherine sometimes published anonymous articles.

## Defining Basics
The identity of Russia in the 18th century posed a dilemma. Was Russia condemned to simply imitate western Europe? Was there a specifically Russian "spirit"?

The Russian Empire was defined by a tsarist autocracy and its alliance with a serf-owning nobility. The latter was not accountable to any authority but the tsar, which created an efficient mechanism to for collecting revenue across the huge realm. The absence of a middle class was filled up by university education in the nineteenth century.  
The Empire had no ethnic or national spirit – there was only an upper class and a working class. Non-Russian aristocrats were treated differently, but much better than serfs in general.

## The Nineteenth Century
The nineteenth century saw a major transformation in Russia's cultural landscape, where the inferiority brought on by Peter's incessant westernisation created a drive for a "Russian" identity, taken up by artists, writers and musicians across the empire.

The Russian occupation of France in the beginning of the century exposed the Russian intelligentsia to the French version of liberty, which brought them to the conclusion that serfdom was the root of the stagnation of art. The call for the abolition of serfdom was taken up by a section of the Russian army called the Decembrists, which staged an uprising in 1825.
