# The Office
## Precise Observation
A feature of realism shown by Turgenev in his writing is how detailed his descriptions and narrative are – up to a level of mundane, everyday observations. He describes clothing, events, durations, and actions minutely, to a degree that could be called almost irrelevant.

## Social Hierarchy
Turgenev's writing is also preoccupied by social critique. For example, note the narrator's observation about a boy laughing louder than all the other manorial staff. The clothing and the manner (his confidence in laughing louder than the others) of this boy lead the narrator to characterise him as an "aristocrat among the manorial staff".

Nikolay Yeremeich also gets offended when Kuprian reminds him that he, too, was a serf before he was made a clerk.

This story is set before the Emancipation of the Serfs, enacted by Tsar Aleksandr II in 1861. Thus Kuprian also points out to his fellow serfs, who have no skill (like he does), and will not be able to get by or pay quit-rent.

Kuprian also mentions a "passport", which is a citizenship card that allowed him to travel within the empire.

# At the Tea-Table
## Karolina Karlovna Pavlova
Karolina Karlovna Pavlova was born into an academic family – her father was a physics lecture in Moscow. She was mainly of German origin, and spoke German, French and Russian. She worked as a translator and a writer of both prose and poetry. She was a Slavophile by persuasion.

"At the Tea-Table" was published in 1859, under the genre of "society tale" (which also includes The Queen of Spades).

She was widely criticised for her work, and considered a "masculine" writer. She did not conform to the expectations held to Russian women writers of her time. These expectations arose from the idea that women had the sensibility to appreciate fine art, and that they were more suited to write about themes related to it.  
Her language, in contrast to the lyrical, dense manner characteristic of, say, Volkonskaya, is straightforward and simple.

## Epigraph 1
The first epigraph is taken from a poem by Heinrich Heine, a 19th-century German poet. It mirrors, to some extent, the scene being described in the (outer) story.

The poem has as a theme the importance of politeness and decorum over what one truly feels. The relation between this and the story is the debate between reason and feeling.

## Epigraph 2
Pavlova uses this epigraph to present a new way of looking at a story, through the mouthpiece of a "madman". The anonymity of this madman makes it impossible to verify who it is – in fact, this quote is written by Pavlova herself.

If a story was abruptly cut off, what would happen? A reader would imagine what happens next, participating more in the creation of the story itself.
