# The Dream: A Letter
Who is the mysterious figure who talks to Princess Volkonskaya in her dream? It is described at one point as a "mummy", and a "daughter of Ancient Egypt", but physical descriptions are contradictory. In some ways, the figure represents Ancient Egypt, as perceived by upper-class Europeans. Furthermore, this comes close on the heels of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt, which set off a mania of Egyptology in European academia.

## Zinaida Alexandrovna Volkonskaya
Until the 17th century, the great majority of women's writing consisted of private correspondence. The 18th century, however, brought to the fore two very influential women writers – Catherine the Great and Yekaterina Dashkova. Nevertheless, predefined notions of femininity and masculinity and the expectation of conformity was traumatic for women writers.  
Zinaida Volkonskaya was known as Moscow's Apollo, not just for her writing but also for her patronage. She belonged to one of Russia's wealthiest and most powerful families, and married into another. Much of her childhood was spent abroad, and French was her first language (like Pushkin, to whom she was a friend and patron). She held one of the most important salons in Moscow – these were places where the "legitimisation of a woman as a creative being turned out to be possible." Nevertheless, women's activity originating in salons was rarely incorporated into the wider literary scene.

She was closely associated – and possibly had an affair – with Tsar Alexander. However, his son and successor, Tsar Nicholas I, pursued anti-minority and autocratic policies. Among the oppressed groups (like Jews, Siberians, nomads), were Roman Catholics, which Princess Volkonskaya secretly was. Tsar Nicholas' reign imposed so many sectarian restrictions on her that she was forced to leave for Rome.

## Classical References
The story has a fascination with classicism running through it. The description of the Princess's childhood "in the shade of Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Italian works of art", the mention of "ideal forms", the tone of worship used to describe mummies, hieroglyphs and Ptah, and the references to Greek and Roman works of art and mythology are all parts of this. The figure in her dream also says that Isis was the "very reflection of [her] life."

## The Figure
In a sense, the figure represents Egypt feminised – "the daughter of Ancient Egypt". The European attitude towards Egypt at this point was one of insatiable curiosity about the secrets of Ancient Egypt, its wisdom and knowledge about universal questions that unite all humanity.
